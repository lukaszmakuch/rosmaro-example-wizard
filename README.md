# Example wizard implemented using Rosmaro

This repository contains the whole application described in the blog post [State machines to the rescue of complex forms](https://medium.com/@lukaszmakuch/state-machines-to-the-rescue-of-complex-forms-867b75790455) together with all the notes I took when designing the wizard.

The code is based on [Rosmaro](https://github.com/lukaszmakuch/rosmaro) which is documented at [rosmaro.js.org](https://rosmaro.js.org/). It makes use of the [simple-server-side-rosmaro-forms](https://github.com/lukaszmakuch/simple-server-side-rosmaro-forms) library. For more information on Rosmaro please check out the [Rosmaro elsewhere](https://rosmaro.js.org/elsewhere/) chapter of its documentation.

In order to run the app, clone this repository and type the following commands:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Then, load _http://localhost:3000/_ in a browser.
